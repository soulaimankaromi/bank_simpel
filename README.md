# bank_simpel
â€¢ We want to create a bank account management application. We
will simplify the types of bank accounts by considering the following diagram:
1.Write the Account.py, AccountCurant.py and AccountSavings.py modules
respectively defining the Account, CurrentAccount and SavingsAccount classes.
2.Write an appropriate constructor for each class.
3.Write the getters corresponding to each attribute.
4. Write the __str() method for each class to construct a chain
representing the information characterizing one of these bank accounts.
